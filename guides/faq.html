    <details class="bg-white p-5 rounded-2xl shadow">
      <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">Are your gemstones & Rudraksha 100% natural and genuine?</summary>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700">
        Yes. We source all items from trusted miners, workshops and suppliers. Each piece is inspected for authenticity, clarity and structural integrity. For high-value stones, we provide lab-certificates when available. We do not sell synthetic or imitation gemstones in our “Natural / Healing / Rudraksha” categories.

    <details class="bg-white p-5 rounded-2xl shadow">
      <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">How do I choose the right gemstone for me?</summary>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700">
        It depends on your intention (healing, protection, prosperity, chakra balance), and if you follow Vedic astrology — your birth chart. We recommend reading our <a href="/guides/how-to-choose.html" class="text-gray-700 underline">How to Choose a Gemstone</a> guide for detailed instructions. For strong stones (like Blue Sapphire, Cat’s Eye, Hessonite etc.) — consult an astrologer before purchase.

    <details class="bg-white p-5 rounded-2xl shadow">
      <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">Can I wear multiple stones or Rudraksha together?</summary>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700">
        Yes — for healing, chakra, and spiritual use, combining gentle stones (like Clear Quartz, Rose Quartz, Amethyst) with Rudraksha is usually safe. For pure astrological gemstones and high-energy Rudraksha (strong mukhi), mixing many together is not recommended unless advised by a qualified astrologer or spiritual guide.

    <details class="bg-white p-5 rounded-2xl shadow">
      <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">How long will my order take to reach me?</summary>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700">
        Delivery time depends on your location and shipping method. Domestic orders within India typically dispatch within 1–3 working days and reach in 4–10 days depending on courier/town. International orders dispatch in 1–4 working days; delivery time depends on destination country, customs clearance and courier service — it usually takes 7–21 days after dispatch.

    <details class="bg-white p-5 rounded-2xl shadow">
      <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">Do I get a refund if I’m not satisfied or if the product is damaged?</summary>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700">
        We allow returns/refunds under certain conditions (see our <a href="/policies/returns-refunds.html" class="text-gray-700 underline">Returns &amp; Refunds Policy</a>). Please inspect your order within 7 days of delivery and inform us with clear photos if there is damage, defect or wrong item. For natural stones, minor inclusions or colour variation — mentioned in description — are not considered defects.

    <details class="bg-white p-5 rounded-2xl shadow">
      <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">Do you ship internationally? What are shipping charges and taxes?</summary>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700">
        Yes, we ship worldwide. Shipping charges depend on weight, value, destination and courier. International orders may attract import duties, customs fees or taxes in the destination country — these are borne by the customer and are not included in product price or our shipping charges.
      </p>

    <details class="bg-white p-5 rounded-2xl shadow">
      <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">How should I care for gemstones and Rudraksha?</summary>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700">
        Gently clean gemstones with soft cloth; avoid harsh chemicals or salt-water for soft / porous stones (like Pearl, Coral, Opal, Malachite). Rudraksha should be kept dry, cleaned occasionally, and oiled lightly to prevent cracking. For detailed care instructions, see our <a href="/guides/how-to-wear-care.html" class="text-gray-700 underline">How to Wear &amp; Care</a> page.
